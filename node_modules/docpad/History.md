## History

- v3.3.2 March 18, 2012
	- Fixed missing interpolation on new version notification
	- Fixed the scandir error with the skeletons path when doing the first run on windows
	- Updated paths to use `path.join` instead of always using forward slashes

- v3.3.1 March 18, 2012
	- Fixed Pygments plugin highlighting the code multiple times for documents with layouts
	- Added `isLayout` and `isDocument` flags to `Document` and `Layout` prototypes

- v3.3.0 February 29, 2012
	- Fixed ruby rendering with ruby v1.8
		- Thanks to [Sorin Ionescu](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu) - [patch here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/commit/a3f711b1b015b2fa31490bbbaca2cf9c3ead3016)
	- The `enabledPlugins` config option will now correctly only overwrite the default values if you have set it to be a string
		- Before it would always incorrectly overwrite the default value if set, which would cause some experimental disabled-by-default plugins to enable
	- Added a [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) Syntax Highlighting plugin
		- It is disabled by default as not everyone would want syntax highlighting, to enable it, add the following to your website's `package.json` file:
			``` javascript
			"docpad": {
				"enabledPlugins": {
					"pygments": true
				}
			}
			```
		- Thanks to [Doug Neiner](https://github.com/dcneiner) for urging it along
	- Added a new `renderDocument` plugin event
		- It is fired after the extensions are rendered, but before the document is rendered inside its layout
		- Useful for things that modify the rendered result of a document, e.g. syntax highlighting, paging, etc
	- Closes
		- [#146](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/pull/146) - Require RubyGems on Ruby 1.8
		- [#137](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/pull/137) - An error occured: Cannot find module 'uglify-js'

- v3.2.8 February 26, 2012
	- Stopped `docpad render` from outputting the welcome message
	- Removed `try..catch`s from plugins, you should do this too
		- The checking is now higher up in the callstack, which provides better error reporting and capturing
	- Fixed a problem with the error bubbling that was preventing template errors from being outputted
	- Fixed the "too many files open" issue thanks to [bal-util](http://github.com/balupton/bal-util.npm)'s `openFile` and `closeFile` utility functions

		- Very useful for development, though you probably want to disable it for production
		- Enabled by default

- v2.3 November 18, 2011
	- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) server support
	- Added `extendServer` configuration option
		- Now, by default, even if the server is provided, we will extend it. If you do not want this, set this configuration option to `false`.
	- Made it easier to load docpad as a module
	- Instead of crashing when an uncaught error happens, it'll output it and keep running
	- The log messages and next handling in `docpad.action` has been cleaned up
		- Now those log messages are contained within the default next handler, so if you provide a custom default next handler you'll have to do your own success log messages
	- [NPM](https://github.com/isaacs/npm) is now installed locally
		- This is to ensure it's availability on cloud servers
	- DocPad will now try and figure out the node executable location to provide greater compatibility on cloud servers
	- If the plugin installations are taking a while, you'll get informed of this, rather than just staring at a blank blinking cursor

		- See the search example in the [kitchensink skeleton](https://github.com/bevry/kitchensink.docpad)
	- Removed deprecated `@Document`, `@Documents`, and `@Site` from the `templateData` (the variables available to the templates). Use their lowercase equivalants instead. This can cause backwards compatibility problems with your templates, the console will notify you if there is a problem.
	- Fixed `docpad --version` returning `null` instead of the docpad version

		- `extensionRendered` is the result extension
		- `filenameRendered` is the result filename: `"#{basename}.#{extensionRendered}"
		- `title` if now set to `filenameRendered` if not set
	- Added support for different meta parsers, starting with [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and [YAML](https://github.com/visionmedia/js-yaml) support. YAML is still the default meta parser
